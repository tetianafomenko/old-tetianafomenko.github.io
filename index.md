# Hi there! 👋

I am Tanya, I live in Brisbane, Australia but still have a close connection to my home, Ukraine!

## Why should this blog exist? 🤔
- Because sharing your thinking is the best way to improve thinking.
- Because learning in public creates serendipity and improves your ideas.
- Because I wish to publish data science projects here in the future.
- Because it gives me an opportunity to learn GitHub Pages.
- Because it has been a rather interesting year for me (or just since the 2020s began, really).

## Why should this blog NOT exist? 🤔
- Because there is already so much useful content on the internet.
- Because it feels like forfeiting my personal privacy.
- Because by sharing/thinking in public exposes me to criticism. 

**But this page exists nonethelss now, so...** 🤷
